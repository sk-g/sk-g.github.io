# Amazon Q Enhancements to My Personal Website

This document outlines the enhancements made to my personal website with the help of Amazon Q.

## 1. ArXiv API Integration

Amazon Q helped implement an ArXiv API integration that allows my website to dynamically fetch and display abstracts for my research publications. This integration:

- Fetches publication abstracts from ArXiv based on paper IDs
- Parses XML responses from the ArXiv API
- Displays abstracts on-demand when users click "Show Abstract"
- Handles error cases gracefully

## 2. Modular HTML Structure

Amazon Q also helped modularize my website's HTML structure, making it more maintainable:

- Created separate component files for each section of the website
- Implemented a JavaScript component loader
- Set up event listeners to handle component loading events
- Updated the main index.html to use this modular approach

## 3. Code Organization

The website now has a cleaner code organization:

```
- index.html - Main HTML file
- style.css - CSS styling
- me.jpg - Profile image
- .gitignore - Git ignore file
- components/ - Modular HTML components
  - header.html - Navigation and header
  - about.html - About section
  - experience.html - Work experience
  - publications.html - Research publications
  - contact.html - Contact information
  - footer.html - Footer section
- js/ - JavaScript files
  - main.js - Component loading and site functionality
  - arxiv.js - ArXiv API integration
```

## 4. Benefits

These enhancements provide several benefits:

- **Better Maintainability**: Each section can be edited independently
- **Dynamic Content**: Abstracts are loaded on-demand, improving page load time
- **Cleaner Code**: Separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand
- **Extensibility**: Easier to add new features or components in the future

## 5. Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements that could be implemented:

- Add a search functionality for publications
- Implement a blog section with markdown support
- Create a projects showcase section
- Add animations for component transitions
- Implement a contact form with serverless backend
